Tatsumaki *Farm*
---
Bot used to *farm exp* and *farm credits* in `Tatsumaki` Bot.

Written in `discord.py`.

Entrance
---
Purpose of this Bot is giving:
* Multi-Accounts Credit Transferring;*
* Daily Credits;
* Reputation Points;

\* - *WIP* (Work in Progress)

Introduction
---
I was trying to make the *Undetectable System*, so bot won't (or at least shouldn't) notice You're *farming*, otherwise Tatsumaki will reset Your reputation points, although this process happens when Your Tatsumaki account hits range of `250`-`999` reputation points, so be careful...
My bot supports up to *10* Multi-Accounts, probably it's enough for giving credits and reputation points to only one account, isn't it? You can make more, if You know how.

Credits don't reset (at least not in my case) so You can *farm* credits whenever You want.
